# BrainTumorClassification using PyTorch CNN
This repository contains code to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) along with the saved network itself (Model Architecture + Parameters).

---

## Project Overview

This model is trained to take in Brain MRI Scans and classify them into 4 categories: Meningioma, Glioma, No, and Pituitary Tumors.

---

## Features

- PyTorch Implementation of CNN
- Training and Evaluation Scripts
- Support for inference with PreTrained weights

---
## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
